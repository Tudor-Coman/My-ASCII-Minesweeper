### My ASCII Minesweeper
Simple Minesweeper game made with the curses.h library.

This is my first game ever made as the final project for my first year
C programming course.

Use the makefile to either compile it to the bin directory with 'make build'
or compile and run it with 'make run'

Use the arrow keys to navigate.
Press 'm' to mark a box or 'x' key to break the boxes.
Press ESC for settings and other goodies.
